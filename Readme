This file contains the essential things of this repository
So while going through the course we essentially moved to install python 3 by going
to python.org and then we installed the python
1. we learned an important syntax to print things at the console in python that is

*print("Hello my name is {} and I am {} years old".format(name,age))* where name and age
are the variables
2. For commenting we learnt that we can comment either by # or by ''' text '''

3. also we can use + like 
print(name+"Lalchandani")

4. We learnt about if statements and elif
5. We learnt about functions
  def hello(name,age):
    print("Hello" + na
   me + "you are {} years".format(age))
6. printing the list will not change the order of the list
7. <list_name>.insert(<where you want to insert>,<listitem>)
8. For deleting a element in the list just type del(dognames[2])
9. For getting a length of the list use len(<listname>)
10. You can store anything in python list
11. for deleting in the dictionary del(<dictName>[])
12. __init__ values are good to provide default values
